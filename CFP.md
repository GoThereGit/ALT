# Call for Participation

# ALT2023：Ancient Language Translation Workshop
Macau SAR, China on Sep 4, 2023, @MT-SUMMIT2023

# Introduction
* As a co-located event with MT-SUMMIT(https://mtsummit2023.scimeeting.cn/en/web/index/), this workshop will provide an opportunity to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages. 
* In this year’s workshop, we propose **two shared tasks on Machine Translation** for Ancient Chinese and Cuneiform language(like Akkadian and Sumerian), respectively, to provide an opportunity to address the unique challenges faced by ancient language machine translation. The technique report papers are required to submit after the evaluation. All papers will be reviewed, and will be selected to appear on **ACL Anthology**.
