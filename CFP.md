# Call for Participation

# ALT2023：Ancient Language Translation Workshop
Macau SAR, China on Sep 4, 2023, @MT-SUMMIT2023

# Introduction
* As a co-located event at MT-SUMMIT(https://mtsummit2023.scimeeting.cn/en/web/index/), this workshop aims to provide an opportunity for practitioners and scholars of interest to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages. 
* To achieve this goal, for this year’s workshop, we propose **two shared tasks on Machine Translation** for Ancient Chinese and Cuneiform languages (including Akkadian and Sumerian), respectively. Each participating team is required to submit the result on their registered shared task(s), and a technical report is required to submit after the evaluation. All papers will be peer-reviewed, and will be selected to appear on **ACL Anthology** (https://aclanthology.org). 
* **Please note** that the workshop only accepts the papers that participate in one or two of the designated shared tasks. Any other related work is strongly recommended to sumbit to events such as the 1st Workshop of Ancient Language Processing (https://www.ancientnlp.com/alp2023/) at RANLP 2013.
