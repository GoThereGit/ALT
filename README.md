# ALT2023：Ancient Language Translation Workshop
Macau SAR, China on Sep 4, 2023, @MT-SUMMIT2023

# Introduction
As a co-located event with MT-SUMMIT(https://mtsummit2023.scimeeting.cn/en/web/index/), this workshop will provide an opportunity to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages. The workshop will conclude with a discussion of the results of the hands-on activities and a summary of the key takeaways from the workshop. Participants will leave the workshop with a deeper understanding of the field of ancient language machine translation and the tools and techniques used to address its unique challenges. In this year’s workshop, we propose shared tasks on Machine Translation for Ancient Chinese and Cuneiform language(like Akkadian and Sumerian), respectively, to provide an opportunity to address the unique challenges faced by ancient language machine translation. The technique reports are required to submit after the evaluation. All papers will be reviewed, and will be selected to appear on ACL Anthology. 

# Objectives
