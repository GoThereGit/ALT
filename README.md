## Ancient Language Processing Workshop
## Introduction: This workshop will provide an opportunity to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages.
## Objectives: The objectives of this workshop are to:
•	Provide an overview of the current state of the field of ancient language machine translation.
•	Discuss the challenges and limitations associated with translating texts written in ancient languages.
•	Provide hands-on experience with machine translation tools and techniques for ancient languages.
•	Foster discussion and collaboration among workshop participants to share experiences, knowledge, and insights.
## Prerequisites: Participants should have a basic understanding of machine translation and experience working with at least one programming language. Familiarity with ancient languages is not required, but participants who have prior experience with ancient languages are encouraged to attend.
## Format: The workshop will consist of lectures, hands-on activities, and group discussions. Participants will work in groups to apply machine translation techniques to sample texts written in ancient languages.
## Topics covered:
•	Overview of machine translation for ancient languages
•	Text preprocessing for ancient language machine translation
•	Techniques for improving translation quality, such as machine learning and data augmentation
•	Challenges associated with translating ancient texts, such as ambiguous word meaning, limited data availability, and orthography
## Equipment: Participants are required to bring a laptop with internet access to participate in the hands-on activities.
## Conclusion: The workshop will conclude with a discussion of the results of the hands-on activities and a summary of the key takeaways from the workshop. Participants will leave the workshop with a deeper understanding of the field of ancient language machine translation and the tools and techniques used to address its unique challenges.
